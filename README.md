# ofxProjectorBlend2
ofxaddon to smoothly blend multiple projector edges together.Update from ofxProjectorBlend

This addon is used to take a normal openFrameworks project and split it into 2 or more pieces that can be projected using 2 or more projectors. This usually involves something like a [Matrox DualHead](http://www.matrox.com/graphics/en/products/gxm/dh2go/digital_se/) or a graphics card with multiple outputs. For the best results, the projectors should also have a hardware blending feature so that the overlapped portions are not brighter than the non-overlapped sections.
